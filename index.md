# Hello!

I'm Jack, and currently a senior in high school, thank you for visiting!

I'm currently a researcher in the Center of Autonomy at the University of Texas at Austin, where I work on a variety of projects related to applications of autonomous systems, maths, physics, and computer science as I study aerospace engineering with a minor in computer science. 

You can check out some of my past projects on this page, or on my Github @igobyjack.

# What i'm interested in

I'd like to start this off by saying I'm still exploring my niche in aerospace, so take everything with a grain of salt. 

For how young the fields of aerospace and computing are, they've changed everything about the way we live. What I'm exploring is how computing can be applied to solve problems in aerospace, an industry tied to the furthering of our understanding. The specific fields I'm exploring are propulsion, and GNC (guidance navigation and control). Propulsion is exactly what it says on the tin, engineering rocket motors and systems to maximize efficiency, power, and reliability. GNC is how a rocket gets where its going, if you've ever watched the movie Apollo 13, almost half the time they're trying to solve problems related to GNC. It requires a pretty broad knowledge base of rocket physics, computer science, and aerospace engineering, which is what makes it so appealing to me.

# Any hobbies?

I love astronomy and general stargazing, and I've been making some first attempts at getting into astrophotograhy, which I'm thinking about posting here. I work on a lot of projects, not many of them useful, with my friends using computers and robotics, as well as building games and competing in gamejams. I really want to start competing in hackathons too.

# Site info

The above simulation of the 3-body problem was built by me in JavaScript, you can check it out on the repository for this site. If you didn't notice, you can click and drag the planets around and see the changes in behavior. I don't think this works on mobile. The rest of the site is built using jekyll.
