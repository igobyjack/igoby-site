# Hello!

I'm Jack, a freshman at the University of Texas, thank you for visiting!

I'm currently a student researcher in the Center of Autonomy at the University of Texas at Austin, where I work on a variety of projects related to applications of autonomous systems as I study aerospace engineering. 

You can check out some of my past projects on this page, or on my Github @igobyjack.

# Site info

The above simulation of the 3-body problem was built by me in JavaScript, you can check it out on the repository for this site. If you didn't notice, you can click and drag the planets around and see the changes in behavior. The rest of the site is built using jekyll.
