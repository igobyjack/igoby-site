    <h2>Optimal Multi-Spacecraft Refueling Planning for Cislunar Operations</h2>
    <img src="assets/images/cislunarpaper.png" alt="orbit maps" width="50%">
    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>As space activities expand within the cislunar environment,
    developing efficient refueling strategies becomes essential
    for sustaining long-term missions. The multi-spacecraft
    refueling problem focuses on optimizing fuel consumption to
    extend mission lifetimes. A multi-fidelity modeling approach
    addresses varying levels of precision, using the two-body problem
    for initial trajectory estimation, the circular restricted
    three-body problem for reference orbits and transfers, and
    the bicircular restricted four-body problem with solar radiation
    pressure for realistic station-keeping costs. The refueling
    problem is formulated as an infinite-horizon Markov decision
    process (MDP), optimizing the refueling strategy while preventing
    fuel depletion. The refueling process consists of two
    phases: first, the refueler transfers into a temporary phasing
    orbit, followed by a final phasing maneuver to rendezvous with
    the target spacecraft. We map the available transfers between
    orbits using a fast sampling technique and select the phasing
    orbit to minimize fuel consumption within a limited synodic
    period. The case study samples orbits from the Lyapunov and
    Halo families around the Lagrange points of the Earth-Moon
    system, L1, L2, and L3. Simulations demonstrate that the MDPbased
    planning achieves a 36% reduction in fuel consumption
    compared to a greedy strategy.</p>
